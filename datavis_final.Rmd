## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
#I got this data from kaggle and it downloaded it and saved it as a csv. It has every team who has made it to the final 4 since 1970 and how far they made it in the final four, as well as the conference they play in




ncaa <- read_csv("~/Challenge_2/ncaa.csv")
#read my data in
#View(ncaa)

summary(ncaa)
#Good all numeric variables are numeric and all categorical variables are characters
head(ncaa)
glimpse(ncaa)
#Create a subset in which I select only teams that currently play in the Pac-12
pac12 = ncaa %>%
  filter(Conference == 'Pacific-10' | Conference == 'Pacific-8' | Conference == 'AAWU' | Conference == 'Pacific- 12' | Conference == 'Pacific Coast' | School == 'Colorado' | School == 'Utah')
# Add a column of 1 so that I can perform arithmatic and add values to sum final 4 appearences
pac12 <- pac12 %>%
  mutate(one = 1)
#There is a problem! UCLA has one data point that has an asterisk, I will remove this from the data because it is in illegitamite championship. I then groupby school to create a variable 'Appearences' which is the sum of my one column for each school.
pac_12_grouped_plot <- pac12 %>%
  filter(School != 'UCLA*') %>%
  group_by(School) %>%                   
  summarise_at(vars(one),        
               list(Appearences = sum))
#Create the plot I may have gone overboard with the color using it as fill just to ensure the viewer gets the point. I then reorder my graph, add proper titles
pac_12_grouped_plot %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(School, -Appearences), y = Appearences, fill = School)) +
  geom_col() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(face = "bold", 
                           size = 7, angle = 90)) +
  scale_y_discrete(name ="Finals Appearences", 
                    limits=c("1","2",'3','4','5','6','7','8','9','10','11','12','13','14','15','16', '17')) +
  scale_x_discrete(name = 'School')
  guides(fill=FALSE)
  ggtitle("Pac-12 Final 4 Appearences") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
  scale_x_discrete(name ="College Team") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Paired")
#Use Paired as colorblind friendly pallete
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
top_dogs <- ncaa %>%
  filter(School == 'Kentucky' | School == 'UCLA' | School == 'Duke' | School == 'Kansas' | School == 'North Carolina')
#Create row of 1 to perform arithmatic
top_dogs <- top_dogs %>%
  mutate(one = 1)
#Create mini algorithm to measure the accumulate appearences between the schools
top_dogs <- top_dogs %>%
  group_by(School, Year) %>%                   
  summarise_at(vars(one),        
               list(Appearences = sum))  %>%
  mutate(Accumulated_appearces = cumsum(Appearences))
#Graph complete with set x and y axis
top_dogs %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Year,y = Accumulated_appearces ,color=School,group=School, yintercept = 0)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  geom_point() +
  scale_y_discrete(name ="Finals Appearences",
                   limits=c("1","2",'3','4','5','6','7','8','9','10','11','12','13','14','15','16', '17','18','19','20')) +
  ggtitle("Cumulative Finals Appearences Since 1940") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
  expand_limits(x = 1940, y = 0)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.



```{r stacked, echo=FALSE}

most_finals <- ncaa %>%
  filter(School == 'Kentucky' | School == 'UCLA' | School == 'Duke' | School == 'Kansas' | School == 'North Carolina' | School == 'Arizona')

most_finals <- most_finals %>%
  mutate(one = 1)

ordered_most_finals <- most_finals[order(-most_finals$`Place (1st, 2nt, 3rd)`),]

ordered_most_finals %>%
ggplot(aes(fill=factor(`Place (1st, 2nt, 3rd)`), y=one, x=School)) + 
  geom_bar(position="fill", stat="identity") +
  labs(fill = "Place") +
  scale_y_continuous(name = 'Percent of Finishes') +
  ggtitle("Historical Finishes in Final 4") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c('navyblue', 'dodgerblue2', 'cadetblue2'))
